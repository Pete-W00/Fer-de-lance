# Generators - this code is just practising using generators (four different generators in this code)


# GENERATOR ONE

def f(x):
    yield x**3
    x += 1

y = f(1)

next(y)      # yields 1
next(y)      # yields 8
next(y)      # yields 27 etc


# GENERATOR TWO

def g():
    a = 10
    yield a
    a = a
    yield a - 1
    a = a - 1
    yield (a - 1)**3
    
g = g()

next(g)   # 10
next(g)   # 9
next(g)   # 512
next(g)   # STOP


# GENERATOR THREE (A generator to sift through a dataframe)

# Firstly create a dataframe 

import pandas
from pandas import DataFrame

data = {"age": [15, 17, 20, 21, 22, 54, 55, 58, 66, 72, 73],                  
        "drives": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]}              # 0 = does not drive, 1 = drive

df = DataFrame(data)

def function(df):
    for i in df.age:
        yield i
        
entry = function(df)

type(entry)             # generator

next(entry)             # 15
next(entry)             # 17
next(entry)             # 20 etc


# GENERATOR FOUR (An improved generator to sift through a dataframe)

# Say we were searching for 18 year olds or younger

def function2(df):
    for i in df.age:
        if i <= 18:
            yield i
        else:
            print("Over 18")
            
entry2 = function2(df)

type(entry2)             # generator

next(entry2)             # 15
next(entry2)             # 17
next(entry2)             # Prints 'Over 18' for the remaining elements and stops the iteration
