# SQL - Inner Joins 

# Fictious data set - a list of pokemon and properties
# The actual data is unimportant providing your tables keep the same column names:
# table1: poko_id, poko, the_type
# table2: poko_id, poko, my_rating, yellow
# table3: poko, my_rating, the_type, common, when_caught, weakness

# Next upload will be outer joins - I need new tables for this as all the data is common here
