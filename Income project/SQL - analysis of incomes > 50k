# Analysis of incomes >50k

CREATE DATABASE employment;
USE employment;  

SELECT*FROM over50k;                       # First observation - 7841 rows from 32561 have salaries >50k

ALTER TABLE over50k                        # age column imported weirdly 
RENAME COLUMN `ï»¿age` TO age;


# Example queries

# Anyone under 25 who earns >50k?
SELECT age
FROM over50k
WHERE age < 25;
# 61 people! From which two are only 19 years old!
# Find out more about the two youn people:
SELECT*FROM over50k
WHERE age = 19;
# One man and one woman, both from the US.


# What education types will likely generate an income that is greater than 50k?
SELECT education, COUNT(education) AS "Education types count"
FROM over50k
GROUP BY education                        
ORDER BY count(education) DESC;
# There are 2221 with a Bachelors degree who earn >50k
# HS-grad accounts for 1675 of those earning >50k


# Next logical question - which occupations generate a salary >50k?
SELECT occupation, COUNT(occupation) AS "Occupation types count"
FROM over50k
GROUP BY occupation                        
ORDER BY count(occupation) DESC;
# The majority are Exec/managerial (1968) and Prof-speciality (1859)
# 191 are from unknown occupations - I haven't cleaned the data fully yet


# What are the hours per week required to earn a salary >50k?
SELECT `hours.per.week`, COUNT(`hours.per.week`) AS "Hours.per.week count"
FROM over50k
GROUP BY `hours.per.week`                        
ORDER BY COUNT(`hours.per.week`) DESC;
# 40hrs is the standard working week to earn >50k
# There is one person who works 3hrs per week and earns over 50k!


# What countries are represented here?
SELECT DISTINCT `native.country`
FROM over50k;
# Natives from 39 + ? are represented in this dataset. Counts:
SELECT `native.country`, COUNT(`native.country`) AS "Native country count"
FROM over50k
GROUP BY `native.country`                        
ORDER BY count(`native.country`) DESC;
# As expected, most people are from the US (7171), then ? (146), then the Philippines (61)
# Say if we wanted to look at the Italian group more closely:
SELECT*FROM over50k
WHERE `native.country` = "Italy";
# And even more specific - female Italians:
SELECT*FROM over50k
WHERE `native.country` = "Italy"
AND sex = "Female";
# 5 people, all working >= 40hrs per week


# How many people have an average education who are earning >50k?
# Education range is 2-16 so let's say the average is 7-11:
SELECT*FROM over50k
WHERE `education.num`
BETWEEN 7 AND 11;
# This band represents just under half the data set (3516)
# One can easily look at the education extremes instead:
SELECT*FROM over50k
WHERE `education.num` = 16;
# 306 people
SELECT*FROM over50k
WHERE `education.num` = 2;
# 6 people


# Say if you wanted men with an "above average" education who are aged under 30 and never married:
SELECT AVG(`education.num`) AS mean_education
FROM over50k;                                           
# Above average education is > 11.6 (e.g. >= 12 for this data set)
SELECT*FROM over50k
WHERE sex = "Male"
AND `education.num` >= 12
AND age < 30
AND `marital.status` = "Never-married";
# This returned 44 people surprisingly - I thought it was quite specific criteria. 
# Add the critera that they have to work in sales:
SELECT*FROM over50k
WHERE sex = "Male"
AND `education.num` >= 12
AND age < 30
AND `marital.status` = "Never-married"
AND occupation = "Sales";
# Reduces to 9 people


# Finally, a count of people from Europe?
SELECT DISTINCT `native.country`
FROM over50k;
# European countries: Greece, Germany, Italy, England, Ireland, Poland, France, Hungary, Scotland
# NB one of the native countries is just listed as 'South' ..? I am assuming that it's not Europe
SELECT `native.country`, COUNT(`native.country`) AS "EuropeCount"
FROM over50k
WHERE `native.country` 
IN ("Greece", "Germany", "Italy", "England", "Ireland", "Poland", "France", "Hungary", "Scotland")
GROUP BY `native.country`
ORDER BY COUNT(`native.country`) DESC;
# Top three are: Germans (44), English (30) and Italians (25)
