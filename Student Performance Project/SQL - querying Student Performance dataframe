# We can query this query by looking at the parental education:

SELECT (77/188)*100;

# What is the male/female distribution of this low performing group?
SELECT gender, COUNT(gender)
FROM studentperformancelow
GROUP BY gender;
SELECT (99/188)*100;
SELECT (89/188)*100;

# What is the race/ethnicity distribution of this low performing group?
SELECT raceEthnicity, COUNT(raceEthnicity)
FROM studentperformancelow
GROUP BY raceEthnicity;
# Group A, B, C, D, E --> 30, 43, 42, 59, 14
# Similar question - parental education distribution for the low performing group?
SELECT parentalEducation, COUNT(parentalEducation)
FROM studentperformancelow
GROUP BY parentalEducation;
# associate's degree - 33
# some college - 38
# high school - 49
# some high school - 46
# master's degree - 6
# bachelor's degree - 16
# Lastly, the crucial question, of the low performing students, how many took the tpc?
SELECT testPreparationCourse, COUNT(testPreparationCourse)
FROM studentperformancelow
GROUP BY testPreparationCourse;
# Yes so only 36/188 completed the tpc which was expected!
